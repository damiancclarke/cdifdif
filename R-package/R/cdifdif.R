#' cdifdif: Spillover Robust Difference-in-Differences Estimation
#'
#' This package implements spillover robust difference-in-differences
#' estimates as described in Clarke (2017).  It tests for local spillovers in a
#' diff-in-diff setting, and optimally determines spillover propagation.
#' It returns estimates of both the treatment effect, as well as (if relevant)
#' the treatment effect on those close to treated, who weren't themselves treated.
